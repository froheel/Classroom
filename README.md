Classroom is a platform where teachers and students are able to communicate effectively with each other. The main objective of Classroom is not only to maintain communication but also share resources with students and track their progress. Teachers can register on Classroom and create a new class to teach. A class code will be generated which can then be shared with students. Students can enroll in classes after registering as students and inserting the class code of the class. The teacher can create new posts and post them in the class. Students can comment on posts and share their opinions. An important feature of the classroom is organization of posts. Teachers can classify a particular post as either Resource or Assignment.  Moreover, the deadline for Assignment can also be selected by the teacher. Students can upload a pdf and submit before the deadline. The joined student list along with the teacher is also visible on the specific classroom. Once the class is no longer needed then it can be deleted by the teacher.

React.js has been used to design the frontend. The design is responsive, pages are all linked together properly and the components are either customized or picked from material.ui & react-bootstrap libraries. The UI is demonstrated in the video link given below with dummy data.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
